# Pizza Hunt

## Purpose
Give the people what they want... PIZZA, no not the delicious, mouth-watering, wine-and-dine kind, but the converstions that surround it. This gives users, the pizza lover's, the mama mia's, and a whole lot more kinds of people a forum to mak their ideal pizza virtually using the CanoCan Mapper and share it with the world wide web. Once you do that you can add it to your handy-dandy, password-protected, unique profile. Come one come all! If a pizza recipe or topping choices catch your eye, let the artist know by hitting that like button and bond over the similar tastes or whatever it was about their poor choices in neglecting their pizza by adding spicy green peppers instead of the milder bell peppers. Now you can even comment on any users mosaic pizza on our website and they will get to read and know the difference. We cannot wait to see just how many ideas we can each create, share, and bond over.
